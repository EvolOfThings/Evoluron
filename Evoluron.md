## Evolution of Neuron

- Breaking a habit doesn't have to be hard. Just by bringing complete awareness and by being watchful of cravings one can easily let go off the habit without any reward-punishment or will power. Repeat this whenever it's necessary and the brain forms a pattern and becomes mechanic to follows the system. The pain you feel (at not immediately getting what you want) is precisely what's helping you break the habit.

- Anything that you imagine yourself to become is definitely possible, even though current circumtances want you to lower your vision. Don't. With consistence and action, universe starts to align itself to try to make way for your visions.

- Meditate

- Taking a long walk helps calm the nerves and provides clarity and peace of mind.

- Make list of tasks and set deadline for each. Review weekly.

- Eat bland food and take cold showers. Avoid instant dopamine hits, practice dopamine disruption technique.

- Take a break. Take a vacation. Be in a nature.

- Toxic relationship is a vile that adsorbs your hard earned life's moral and wisdom.

- Process is what achieves the end goal, no matter how unrealistic the goal may seem at your current skill level.

- Think about what you are doing, why you are doing and how will it help you in short term and long term, what's is more important and then proceed.

- Always try to get back to your center. The center of your existence, the awareness you came about in meditation. That's the only way you will find your way back if you are lost in the hedonist world ways.

- Decide and head in that direction, the journey will chnage you not the destination.

- Revisit the plans, goals, promises and your personal morals to analyze the efficiency of your program.

- If there's a hard decision that you are conflicted about, first think what makes it a hard decision and then make a decision that meets your end goal.

- Every man has two lives, and the second begins when he realizes he has only one. [Confucius] I'm here.

- Take care of health.

- Read. Whenever you have time to spare read a book.

- Human behaviors are often tied to one another. Habits have domino effect, that may good habits or bad ones. They tend to chain to one another and the process brings about a significant change. Just start with one and slowly you will change most of your ways for good.

- The only way is the way of disruption. Disruption causes destruction as well as creation.

- Breaking into something new always needs a discipline, and reinforce that discipline with all your willpower, once you gain momentum, there's no need of willpower but discipline has to be there beneath the activity just so you don't back away from temporary hardship of the new skill.

- silence...

- Treat your body like it's 2nd system and the one that's run by a child constantly craving for instant gratification. The other one being aware of what's the right thing to do subjectively. In order to discipline the child use a treat for a task method. give a treat of instant gratification and do the task so the pattern is established, making brain think the task is actually gratifying and with enough repetitions it'll become stronger and it becomes a habit.

- Practice Vipassana everyday.

- Failed? Try again. Don't quit before you have tried again.

- You can dream or achieve anything you want and there's nothing wrong in wanting to achieve many things, but priorties gotta be in right order. When your priorties are in order, you can achieve anything you want to achieve.

- Focus all your energy on the highest priority. To be able to focus, first you need to learn how to focus. It is through meditation, no not by closing your eyes rather by bringing your awareness to the task that's at the highest priority. It is difficult but it gets easier eventually. Focus.

- Virtue and Self control are the most important factors that determine the extent of self improvement. Strive in self-control through means of awareness.

- Bring awareness to the present.

- Take care of Body and Mind.

- Affirmations with visualization, irrespective of how far fetched it might be from your current status. It may not bring you the exact fortune or goals but it shall conodition your mind to work towards it and anything that's action oriented with unwavering focus is bound to give desirable results.

- Longing to feel the way you once felt is a weakness most people have. Instead of reliving the past, use your new state to rediscover yourself.

- Dont want to do it? This is the perfect time to do it.

- Action. Start.

- You are what you think you are. It is 100% percent possible what you set out to achieve, just stay persistent and keeo reminding yourself why you need to do it when you feel like not doing or about to fall off wagon. Before you know it, the results starts to pour in when you are just quarter way to the goal, the universe starts to make way for you.

- Remind yourself the Whys of a pursuit. You will get through any hurdles faced. This is how you build persistent perseverance bit by bit and trust that momentum will take care of the rest. This brings about a character you've admired to become.

- Recondition your connectome to reorient the world's connectome to get what you want and you will.

- Cult. Making something a ritual brings about a culture. A culture that has set of beliefs, beliefs to achieve goals. Make a cult for your fitness routine for life.

- When and body and mind are aligned, something happens inside you(awarness in the dormant stage awakens). If there's something out of alignment, your awareness shows it to you in many ways to signal you to correct it through either body or mind. When you listen to it, and follow it...[to be continued...]

- Keep pedaling, look where you want to go.

- It is time when it is time.

- Keep going when it's the hardest.

- Hope. It doesn't offer itself up. One has to use the imagination, Imagine the solution and work to make it a reality.
        "Whole world pivots on the acts of imagination."

- Only in darkness are we revealed. Goodness us is not goodness that seeks advantage. Good is good in the final hour, in the deepest pit without hope, without witness, without reward, Virtue is only virtue in extremis. - Hooded Figure (from Doctor Who)

- Wake up, Code, Workout and Repeat.

- Set things in motion, momentum kicks in, and the things will change readically.

- A task with an effort on a streak gains momentum proportionally to the efforts. However, the duration of the goal is unpredictable. But Pareto Principle can help reach the goal sooner. 11/11

- Take a small step, stay consistent with it.

- Always be proactive physically even if there's fatigue or lethargy. Physical movement chnages the dynamics of it.

- Set yourself a new limit everytime you get a chance, even if it seems impossible at that moment.

- The only way you will be able to unbundle your potential is after you have accepted yourself. Move past it. True relationships will be built there after that stands til the time ends.

- Don't be afraid to make your point. The point, the revelation, the insight, you went through an experience to get to that point. Don't let it go for a vain. Amend it if there's a feedback that comes from a credible source or a person.


- Just look up to the Stars.

- Just do it even when you feel like not doing it. Just after the tiny step of action builds just enough momentum to make you keep going and when you look back, you will be awed at yourself! Just do it!

- Visualize your goal, don't waste a min in a day. plan every minute of the day to work towards it.

- When the circumstances are absolutely overwhelming, just take a deep breath and tell yourself that "It's all going to be alright, one day at a time towards the progress".

- Avoiding failure leads to lead a failed life.

- When lost or in a bad headspace, start fresh. Don't go for self improvement now, go for self transformation. It is radically changing the way you do things.

- Sometimes you've got to keep going even if it gets too dark, you will come out of the tunnel.

- Get back again!

- Go deep into your own mind to find out the possible causes of your worries, fears, restlessness, procrastination and anything that's making you not peace with yourself.

- Keep trying!

- Self transform to change the existing reality.

- If a decision seems hard, then it's the action you are worried about. You are afraid you can't follow through the decision hence ambiguity in making a decision. How to deal with it? You decide something and you will act on it, but how to keep up with the action til the end goal is another question. What do you need here? Being persistent with your action, what fuels the persistence? Why? Why do you need to reach the end goal? How badly you want to reach it? "Why" is the only question you should ask yourself when there's a decision to make and to keep with the action.

- The struggle is real. Struggle to discipline, struggle to start, struggle to stick with a decision, struggle to stay authentic. That's the struggle that will get one to the one's dream's place. Making through that struggle is what will make your character, the character that is asked by the future you.

- Having just principles isn't enough, one has to assert values only then they become real.

- Just start living very execessively.

- Your cooperation with the things you don't like is what will keep you imprisoned. Drop the coooperation, don't put any effort or thoughts into it. If you do, it will only become significant so just do it instantly.

- Your unconscious conditioning is the reason you are where you are right now. Become more alert to the moment and do things in spur of moment towards the goal.

- The finishing line is a lot closer once you start running towards it.

- If you are not conscious of each moment, you will just drift away in life aimlessly. Have a goal and work towards it, avoid anything that takes you a step back.

- Day dream with respect to your current priority or the skill you are developing.

- Relax into who you are first, then plan and execute who you want to be.

- Don't think about whats of after the goal, think only about the goal until you've reached it.

- Act like your future you.

- Certainity comes at a price.
