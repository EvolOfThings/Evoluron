## Evolution of Neuron

- Breaking a habit doesn't have to be hard. Just by bringing complete awareness and by being watchful of cravings one can easily let go off the habit without any reward-punishment or will power. Repeat this whenever it's necessary and the brain forms a pattern and becomes mechanic to follows the system. The pain you feel (at not immediately getting what you want) is precisely what's helping you break the habit.

- Anything that you imagine yourself to become is definitely possible, even though current circumtances want you to lower your vision. Don't. With consistence and action, universe starts to align itself to try to make way for your visions.

- Meditate

- Taking a long walk helps calm the nerves and provides clarity and peace of mind.

- Make list of tasks and set deadline for each. Review weekly.

- Eat bland food and take cold showers. Avoid instant dopamine hits, practice dopamine disruption technique.

- Take a break. Take a vacation. Be in a nature.

- Toxic relationship is a vile that adsorbs your hard earned life's moral and wisdom.

- Process is what achieves the end goal, no matter how unrealistic the goal may seem at your current skill level.

- Think about what you are doing, why you are doing and how will it help you in short term and long term, what's is more important and then proceed.

- Always try to get back to your center. The center of your existence, the awareness you came about in meditation. That's the only way you will find your way back if you are lost in the hedonist world ways.

- Decide and head in that direction, the journey will chnage you not the destination.

- Revisit the plans, goals, promises and your personal morals to analyze the efficiency of your program.

- If there's a hard decision that you are conflicted about, first think what makes it a hard decision and then make a decision that meets your end goal.

- Every man has two lives, and the second begins when he realizes he has only one. [Confucius] I'm here.

- Take care of health.
